# UniverseCity

Universecity is a groundbreaking application redefining communication within universities. This comprehensive management system offers real-time classroom occupancy tracking, allowing students to reserve seats in case lecture halls are full. It also provides detailed charts and achievements to monitor individual student progress. Both teachers and secretariats can instantly share announcements, fostering seamless communication throughout the academic ecosystem. What sets Universecity apart is its innovative feature for COVID-19 detection. The system can detect if someone in a classroom has COVID-19 and immediately makes an announcement to close off nearby seats, prioritizing the safety and well-being of students and faculty.
